My Lovely Horse,
Running through the field,
Where are you going,
With your fetlocks blowing,
In the wind.

I want to shower you with sugar lumps,
And ride you over fences,
I want to polish your hooves every single day,
And bring you to the horse dentist.

My lovely horse,
You're a pony no more,
Running around,
With a man on your back,
Like a train in the night,
Like a train in the night!
